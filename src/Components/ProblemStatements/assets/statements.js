      des: `One of the effective control methods is disease identification based on the analysis of digital images, with the possibility of obtaining them in field conditions, using mobile devices. 
      You must purpose a method for the recognition of class of rice disease.
      This problem focuses on designing a system for disease diagnosis in rice using a public dataset of images of diseased and healthy rice collected either from the internet or directly from fields under varying conditions. The students can use machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, or any of the techniques they find suitable to achieve the task of disease identification in rice.
      From an input test image of rice crop, the trained learning model should be able to detect whether or not the image has diseased crop and if yes, then the model should be able to classify the class of disease present in the image and if the image has no disease, then classify it as "healthy" class. Each image belongs to only a single class.
      `,
      data: `"Dataset_PS1" contains labelled images of 7 classes, 6 disease classes and one "Healthy" class. These are separated in 7 folders, one folder for each class. There is a "test" folder containing a mix of images from all classes that is meant for testing of model at the end. 
      The recognition method must be implemented as a bot on the Telegram platform, which allows users to assess plants by lesions in the field conditions. You have to implement the bot on Telegram as reported in the paper mentioned in Problem statement-1. It should be multilingual and support Hindi, English and Punjabi. It will better if you implement the feature of speech recognition in this telegram bot. After recognising the disease, bot must guide the farmer for the possible treatment of the disease. For possible treatment of each disease you can search the web and recommend the farmer accordingly. Also watch this video for better understanding

      des: `Weeds are harmful, sometimes poisonous plants that grow in a crop field where they are not desired. They negatively impact the growth of the crop, and eventually, it affects the quality and quantity of production. The aim of this problem statement is to create an artificial intelligence powered system that detects weeds in rice and wheat crop, when the input is in the form of images. By detection, we mean detecting the weed in an image either in the form of segments or bounded boxes and classifying its correct class. Using the dataset which contains images of rice and wheat with weeds, and annotations giving details of classes of weeds, the teams need to create a model that identifies weedsâ€™ locations in an image and their classes, correctly and optimally, employing any of the available techniques like machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, etc.`,

All these folders contain a folder "images" (that has the images of crop) and the corresponding annotations file called "weedcoco.json" (the annotations file follows the COCO format). There is a "test" folder that contains images on which the model will be finally tested.

This problem statement is formulated to create an application that gives information about irrigation requirements for a crop. The application obtains values of parameters that affect irrigation requirements of a crop using remote and on-ground sensors and then using suitable methods and known knowledge, calculates the quantity of water required for irrigation daily or as required regularly. The input parameters include soil moisture, temperature, pressure, humidity and luminosity (sunlight). The teams need to derive relation between these parameters and the water need of the crop such that the yield of the crop is maximized and resource utilization is optimal. Keep in mind the other parameters that affect the final result like the crop type and its growth stage. And on that basis, the application should provide the time/schedule of irrigation and amount of irrigation needed. 
Based on Crop Irrigation needs as suggested by Food and Agriculture Organization in their white paper on Irrigation and Drainage Paper given below designed the algorithm to calculate the water needs based on type of crop, soil type, age of the crop etc.`,

The accurate prediction of these parameters can help a farmer plan well in terms of irrigation needs and other requirements so as to maximize crop yield both in terms of quality as well as quantity. This problem statement is formulated with a twofold aim in mind. First, to study existing patterns of environmental parameters like humidity, air temperature etc. using data collected through on ground sensors or remote sensing, across a time series to predict future values of these environmental parameters. And second, to formulate the relationship between these parameters and the yield of crop. To be precise, the teams are expected to predict yield values based on these input parameters.`,

Vegetation indices.xlsx contains values of different vegetation indices. The teams have to analyze this data to make a time series prediction model that predicts values of environmental parameters, soil moisture, humidity, temperature, pressure, and luminosity (sunlight) for the next interval. Also, the teams have to predict the final yield of the wheat crop based on these parameters. The teams are free to use any model or technique to achieve the task.
